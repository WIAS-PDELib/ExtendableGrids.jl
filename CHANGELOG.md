# Changelog

## [1.12] - 2024-11-29
- Allow TetGen v1 and v2
- Code sustainability improvements: pre-commit, codespell

## [1.11] - 2024-11-16
-  Update show method. Have different methods for REPL and interpolation
- make it compatible with planned improvement of show method for VoronoiFVM.System

## [1.10.5] - 2024-11-14

### Changed

- `dim_space`, `num_nodes` and `num_cells` return now `0` if there is no grid key `Coordinates` or `CellNodes`, respectively

## 2024-10-28
Moved repository from https://github.com/j-fu/ExtendableGrids.jl to https://github.com/WIAS-PDELib/ExtendableGrids.jl. [WIAS-PDELib](https://github.com/WIAS-PDELib/) is a github organization created to collectively manage the Julia packages developed under the lead of the [WIAS Numerical Mathematics and Scientific Computing](https://wias-berlin.de/research/rgs/fg3)  research group. According to the [github docs on repository transfer](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/transferring-a-repository#whats-transferred-with-a-repository), all links to the previous repository location are automatically redirected to the new location, and all relationships with forks stay intact.

## [1.10.0]  - 2024-09-29
- Allow to map functions with vector arguments onto grid
  E.g. for `f(x)=sum(x)` one can now do `map(f,grid)`.
- Make parts of simplexgrid constructor optional. 
  E.g. it is possible now to do just `simplexgrid(coord, cellnodes)`. In that
  case, e.g. `grid[BFaceRegions]` will return a zero length vector.
  
## [1.9.0]  - 2024-07-07
- Add edge partitioning induced from cell partitioning
- Overhaul of partitioning API

## [1.8.0] - 2024-06-24

- Recursive metis partitioning

## [1.7.0] - 2024-06-17
- Partitioning for multithreading
- Metis extension

- SubGrid type has now a parameter that knows the support relative to parent grid, removed BoundarySubGrid type
- removed `get_facegrid`, `get_bfacegrid`, `get_edgegrid` in `derived.jl` (that offer no new functionality compared to subgrid)
- fixed default behaviour for coordinatesystem and restricted 1D coordinate sorting to project = true

## [1.6.1] - 2024-06-07
